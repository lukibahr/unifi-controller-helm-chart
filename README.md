# DEPRECATED: Unifi Controller Helm Chart

As I will no longer run unifi controller on my k3s cluster and I've shut down my cluster for an unknown time, I'll no longer maintain this helm chart.

The unifi controller helm chart installs a unifi controller software onto your kubernetes cluster. A Kubernetes cluster (k3s, kind, K8s, or anything else) is required. For exposing the ports, MetalLB or any other LoadBalancer implementation is required.

## Controller ports

The following is a list of ports that are used by the unifi controller. The ports are exposed by a MetalLB service to be discoverable in your network.

|Protocol|Port|Purpose|
|--|--|--|
|UDP|3478|Port used for STUN.|
|UDP|5514|Port used for remote syslog capture|
|TCP|8080|Port used for device and application communication|
|TCP|8443|Port used for application GUI/API as seen in a web browser|
|TCP|8880|Port used for HTTP portal redirection|
|TCP|8843|Port used for HTTPS portal redirection|
|TCP|6789|Port used for UniFi mobile speed test|
|TCP|27117|Port used for local-bound database communication|
|UDP|5656-5699|Ports used by AP-EDU broadcasting|
|UDP|10001|Port used for device discovery|
|UDP|1900|Port used for "Make application discoverable on L2 network" in the UniFi Network settings|

## Security issues
